Powershell Scripts &amp; Functions

Copy the functions you want into your %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Powershell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 file if you want to use them globally.

You might also have to create the Powershell folder and profile file as well.

Example:
  Convert-All-FFMPEG "mp4" "mkv" "-c:v libsvtav1 -c:a libopus"
